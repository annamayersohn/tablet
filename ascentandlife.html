        <h3>Tintagel (Cornwall, England)</h3>

          <p>Tintagel is the name of both a coastal Cornish village and the ruined 13th-century castle to which the village is home. It was here, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <cite>History of the Kings of Britain</cite>, that Duke Gorlois of Cornwall sequestered his wife Igerna (also known as Igraine) in a castle, and it was here that King Uther Pendragon, with the help of Merlin, tricked his way through Gorlois’ defenses and conceived Arthur with the duchess. Geoffrey implies that the castle at Tintagel is particularly secure, and indeed, the current ruins are situated on a high, rocky peninsula connected to the mainland only by a narrow neck. If Gorlois’ castle was built on the same site, it would have been very easy to defend against an army, although not against Merlin’s magic.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey was writing in the 1130s, about a century before Richard, Earl of Cornwall, built the castle whose half-crumbled walls still stand on the headland. He did not base Gorlois’ castle on any structure he could have seen with his own eyes. But 20th- and 21st-century archaeology has shown that he was correct to envision a prosperous settlement at the site in the post-Roman era. Excavations at Tintagel have revealed that from the 5th to the 7th century, the site was a thriving trade center receiving high-quality pottery from all over the Mediterranean. Perhaps memories of Tintagel’s past as a site of royalty or nobility led Geoffrey to depict it as the site of Arthur’s conception.</p>

          <p>Another geological feature of Tintagel that has worked its way into the legend is the natural tunnel known as “Merlin’s Cave.” Formed by the erosive effect of the ocean waves, it runs from one side of the peninsula all the way to the other for a total length of about 330 feet. At high tide, the cave fills with water, but at low tide, you can walk right through.</p>

          <img src="images/places/dozmary1.jpg" alt="Dozmary Pool from a distance">
          <p>Dozmary Pool has perhaps the weakest claim to fame of all the places featured on this site. This lake on Bodmin Moor is said to be where Arthur received the sword Excalibur (not to be confused with the sword in the stone) from the magical Lady of the Lake. Said by whom? It’s unclear, and it’s also unclear whether this rumor represents a genuine belief or simply an attempt to gain some prestige for a local landmark. Regardless, a visitor with a powerful imagination can easily envision an arm clad in white samite breaking through the surface to brandish a glittering sword, and a less imaginative visitor can just enjoy the placid water.</p>

          <img src="images/places/dozmary2.jpg" alt="Dozmary Pool up close">
          <p>The episode of Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake first appears in the 13th-century French <cite>Vulgate Cycle</cite>, but it may been inspired by something real. Bronze and Iron Age Britons are known to have deposited weaponry in bodies of water, possibly as votive offerings. Perhaps medieval discoveries of ancient swords discarded in lakes inspired the idea of, in the words of Monty Python, “strange women lying in ponds distributing swords.”</p>

        <h3>Badbury Rings (Dorset, England)</h3>

          <div class="border"></div>
          <img src="images/places/badbury1.jpg" alt="view from Badbury Rings">
          <p>Of all the feats and adventures attributed to Arthur, the battle of Mount Badon (or Badon Hill) is possibly the one most likely to have a historical basis, even if no one named Arthur actually participated. The battle is first mentioned by Gildas in the 5th or 6th century in <cite>On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain</cite>. Gildas’ Latin prose in this passage is both vague and convoluted, but he seems to be saying that sometime in the 5th century AD, the Britons won a victory against a longtime enemy (the Saxons?) at Mount Badon. By the time Nennius wrote the <cite>History of the Britons</cite> in the 9th century, this victory had been attributed to Arthur. The true location of Mount Badon has generated much speculation, and one of the top contenders is the Iron Age hillfort called Badbury Rings.</p>

          <img src="images/places/badbury2.jpg" alt="view of Badbury Rings">
          <p>The “rings” refer to the earthworks built into the sides of this hill, a typical feature of hillforts. These earthworks consist of a series of alternating mounds and ditches, giving the hill the appearance of wrinkles. Presumably the hill once boasted additional defensive features such as palisades. Archaeological finds suggest reoccupation in the post-Roman period, but little information is available about that era of the hill’s history. In the year 899, Badbury Rings was nearly the site of a battle between the English king Edward the Elder and a challenger to his throne, his cousin Æthelwold, but the battle never materialized.</p>

        <h3>Cadbury Castle (Somerset, England)</h3>
        <div class="horizontal unit">
          <div class="border"></div>
          <img src="images/places/cadbury1.jpg" alt="Sign reading ‘Castle Lane Leading to Camelot Fort’">
          <p>Cadbury is quite similar in appearance to its fellow Iron Age hillfort at Badbury, but the sign boldly identifying it as “Camelot Fort” hints at the difference in the magnitude of these two sites’ Arthurian ties. Cadbury has been associated with Arthur’s famed capital Camelot since at least the 16th century. In 1542, the antiquarian John Leland visited the nearby village of South Cadbury and wrote that the locals told him that Cadbury and Camelot were one and the same. If Arthur ever existed, he almost certainly did not live at a place called Camelot, given that the first known usage of this name is in the romances of the 12th-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes. This fact does not makes the association between Camelot and Cadbury less significant. On the contrary, it shows how the Arthurian legend was (and is) so treasured, it worked its way into the British landscape in a way no other story has achieved.</p>

          <img src="images/places/cadbury2.jpg" alt="Cadbury Castle">
          <p>The Arthurian significance of Cadbury does not end with local folk tradition. An archaeological excavation in the 1960s, led by Leslie Alcock, revealed that the hill had been reoccupied in the post-Roman period, and judging by the scale of the refortifications, it had become quite an important base of military power.  Archaeologists at the time expected to find 5th- or 6th-century refortifications at a similar scale at other Iron Age hillforts, yet dig after dig revealed nothing remotely comparable to what Alcock’s team found at Cadbury. Although his name may or may not have been Arthur, clearly someone very important occupied Cadbury Castle in that period.</p>

        <h3>Caerleon (Newport, Wales)</h3>
        <div class="horizontal unit">
          <div class="border"></div>
          <img src="images/places/caerleon.jpg" alt="Caerleon amphitheatre">
          <p>The town of Caerleon is home to the ruins of a Roman fortress called Isca Augusta, which was constructed in the 80s AD and served as the headquarters of the Legion II Augusta. Caerleon means “fortress of the legion” in Welsh. Of all the impressively preserved remnants of this fortress, the most famous is the Caerleon Amphitheatre, an oval-shaped arena that could seat up to six thousand spectators. Caerleon’s Arthurian association dates back at least to the 1130s, when Geoffrey of Monmouth depicted the city as the site of Arthur’s coronation. It may date back even further: the 9th-century <cite>History of the Britons</cite> states that Arthur fought a battle at “the City of the Legion,” although this may refer to a different city with a legionary fortress. Geoffrey does not mention the large round mound under which the unexcavated amphitheatre lay, but later folklore associated the mound with the Round Table.</p>
