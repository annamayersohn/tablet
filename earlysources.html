      <h2>Early Sources</h2>
      <p>On this page you will learn about the earliest sources for the story of Arthur. Some of these discuss Arthur in detail, some only obliquely, and some not at all. They have been arranged in an approximately chronological order, but an absolute chronology is impossible to establish: first, because many of these works come to us only in manuscripts that are surely much later than the original composition; second, because this chronological gap leaves room for the possibility of spurious interpolations; and third, because some of these works may have grown out of an oral tradition and therefore cannot be said to have been composed at one specific point in time. Hover over or select a source to learn more. (All photos on this page are from Pixabay.)</p>

            <div class="title"><h3>On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain</h3></div>
            <h4>Gildas, 5th or 6th cent.</h4>
            <p>In <cite>On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae)</i> the British monk Gildas portrays the coming of the Saxons as a divine punishment for the sinful ways of the native Britons. It is the most thorough surviving work from post-Roman Britain, and therefore Arthur’s absence in its narrative casts major doubt on his historicity. Nevertheless, <cite>On the Ruin</cite> is an essential step in tracing the evolution of Arthurian legend: it is the first work to describe British resistance against the Saxons, and it is the first to mention the battle of Mount Badon (Latin: <i lang="la">Mons Badonicus</i>), a battle later attributed to Arthur. Gildas implies that Mount Badon was a British victory, and it is usually assumed that the Saxons were the other party, but he does not actually spell out the identity of the Britons’ opponents.

            <h4>Attrib. Aneirin, 7th cent.?</h4>
            <p><cite>The Gododdin</cite> (Welsh: <i lang="cy">Y Gododdin</i>) is one of the oldest surviving works of Welsh poetry, and generally considered the oldest work in any language to mention Arthur, although the reference to Arthur may be a later interpolation, or it may refer to a different Arthur. The poem recounts the battle of the British kingdom of Gododdin against the Angles at a place called Catraeth (thought to be Catterick, North Yorkshire) around the year 600. The Angles nearly annihilated the warriors of Gododdin, but the poet (traditionally thought to be the contemporary Welsh bard Aneirin) praises the latter’s prowess and their courage against overwhelming odds. One casualty was a man named Gwarddur, who “brought black crows to a fort’s / Wall, though he was not Arthur” (translation by <a href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/a01b.html">Joseph P. Clancy)</a>.

            <h4>Attrib. Nennius, 9th cent.</h4>
            <p><cite>The History of the Britons</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">Historia Brittonum</i>) provides an eclectic mixture of accurate facts, garbled history, and myth, cobbled together from various sources. It is traditionally attributed to the Welsh monk Nennius, but he may not have been the only contributor, if he even existed at all. As part of the narrative of the Saxon invasion, “Nennius” lists twelve battles fought by Arthur, including Mount Badon. In addition, an appendix to the work lists <i lang="la">mirabilia</i>, or marvels, to be found in Britain and Ireland, two of which relate to Arthur. One is the tomb of Arthur’s son Amr, which changes size every time it is measured. The other is a stone bearing the paw print of Arthur’s dog Cabal (also known as Cavall); every time it is removed from its place on a heap of stones, it finds its way back like a loyal friend.</p>

            <div class="title"><h3>The Annals of Wales</h3></div>
            <h4>Unknown, 10th cent.</h4>
            <p>The <cite>Annals of Wales</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">Annales Cambriae</i> are a record of events in Britain and Ireland from the 5th century through the 10th. Two entries mention Arthur: in approximately 516, the Britons, led by Arthur, are said to have vanquished an unspecified foe at Mount Badon; in approximately 537, “Arthur and Medraut” are said to have fallen in the battle of Camlann. This latter entry is the first appearance of the character now best known as Mordred. Despite the <cite>Annals’</cite> matter-of-fact tone, they are clearly not a reliable record of history. (The entry just before the battle of Mount Badon records the death of one Bishop Ebur at the age of 350.) But there are indications that the writers had access to lost sources. For example, while the second entry is the oldest known reference to the battle of Camlann, its use of the Welsh word for “battle” rather than the Latin one suggests that the chronicler was working from a Welsh source.</p>

            <p><cite>What Man is the Doorkeeper?"</cite> (Welsh: <i lang="cy">Pa Gur yv Y Portawr?</i>) is a Welsh poem in the form of a dialogue between Arthur and a porter called Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr. Arthur and some of his warriors, including Cai (Arthur’s foster brother, Sir Kay the Seneschal, in later literature), seek entrance to the fortress that Glewlwyd guards. To persuade the porter to open the door, Arthur boasts of his own feats and those of his companions, especially Cai. The poem is preserved only in a 13th century manuscript, and it ends mid-sentence, indicating that the text in the manuscript is an incomplete version of the original poem.</p>

            <h4>Attrib. Taliesin, unknown date</h4>
            <p><cite>The Spoils of Annwfn</cite> (Welsh: <i lang="cy">Preiddeu Annwfn</i>) is a Welsh poem attributed to the bard Taliesin. Cryptic and fantastical, it tells the story of Arthur and his warriors journeying to the Welsh otherworld, Annwfn, to find a magic cauldron. Taliesin is thought to have performed at the court of Urien of Rheged, who is one of the few definitively historical figures to be incorported into Arthurian legend, in the 6th century. The poem itself, meanwhile, survives only in a 13th century manuscript, but the language is hard to pin down to a specific time period, leaving the origins of the poem as enigmatic as the story it tells. <cite>The Spoils of Annwfn</cite>, with its quest for a magical vessel, may be a precursor to the story of the Holy Grail.</p>

            <p>The Welsh Triads (Welsh: <i lang="cy">Trioedd Ynys Prydein</i>, literally “the Triads of the Island of Britain”) are a group of brief texts, each listing three things in a certain category, such as “Three fair lords of the Island of Britain” or "Three loyal households of the Island of Britain." Culled together from various medieval manuscripts and thought to serve as mnemonic devices for bards, several of the Triads mention Arthurian characters. One triad, for instance, lists “Three wives of Arthur,” all of whom are called Gwenhwyvar (the Welsh form of Guinevere).</p>

            <p><cite>Culhwch and Olwen</cite> (Welsh: <i lang="cy">Culhwch ac Olwen</i>) is a prose tale first found in written form in an early 14th century manuscript, although the language points to an earlier date of composition. It tells the story of Culhwch, a young man cursed to love Olwen, the daughter of a fearsome giant. Culhwch calls upon the help of his kinsman, Arthur—portrayed here as a warrior chieftain rather than a king. Most of the tale consists of the bizarre feats Culhwch must perform to win Olwen. It is also notable for the descriptions of the eccentric warriors who accompany Culhwch.</p>

            <p><cite>The Deeds of the Kings of the English</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">Gesta Regum Anglorum</i>) contains one of the earliest allusions to the folk belief in Arthur’s eventual messianic return. William himself, however, is frustrated by his countrymen’s mythologization of Arthur and argues that he should be remembered as a historical hero rather than a legendary one. <cite>The Deeds of the Kings of the English</cite> is also notable as the first known work to mention a character who would become a key player in the legend: Arthur’s nephew Gawain.</p>

            <h4>Geoffrey of Monmouth, 1136</h4>
            <p>Written by a Welsh cleric and allegedly based on an ancient book in a native British language, the twelve-book <cite>History of the Kings of Britain</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">Historia Regum Britanniae</i>) tells the story of Britain from the arrival of the legendary Brutus (great-grandson of the Trojan hero Aeneas) to the death of the historical Welsh king Cadwallader in the 7th century. The last five books contain the oldest complete written narrative of Arthur’s life, starting with his deceitful begetting by Uther Pendragon (brother of Ambrosius Aurelianus) and ending with the battle of Camlann, at which he slays his treacherous nephew Mordred but is himself mortally wounded and taken to the magical Isle of Avalon. Merlin features as a supporting character in Arthur’s story, but Geoffrey also wrote other two works focusing on Merlin. Geoffrey undoubtedly stands alongside Chrétien de Troyes and Thomas Malory as one of the most influential individuals in the history of the Arthurian tradition.</p>

            <p><cite>The Legend of Saint Goeznovius</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">Legenda Sancti Goeznovii</i>) purports to have been composed in 1019, although some scholars suspect a later date. Before recounting the life of the saint, who was born in Britain but moved across the Channel to Brittany to escape the Saxons, the writer, who simply calls himself William, recaps the history of the Saxon incursion and the British resistance. While some aspects of William’s narrative align with that of Geoffrey, other aspects indicate that "William" had sources unknown to Geoffrey, perhaps sources originating from Brittany rather than Britain. If the 1019 date is accurate, this would be the oldest known text to identify Arthur as a king.</p>

            <p>In <cite>The Instruction of a Ruler</cite> (Latin: <i lang="la">De Principis Instructione</i>), Gerald, a Welsh archdeacon of Norman descent, details the character traits and historical knowledge he deems essential for a leader. From an Arthurian perspective, this work is valuable as a contemporary account of the alleged discovery of Arthur’s grave on the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey. It also contains one of the earliest references to Arthur’s sister Morgan, best known as Morgan le Fay. Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his <cite>Life of Merlin</cite>, had mentioned a Morgan who received a wounded Arthur at the mythical Isle of Avalon after the battle of Camlann, but Gerald was apparently the first to identify this character as a member of Arthur’s family.</p>
