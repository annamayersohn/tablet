        <p>The Arthurian legend has both subsumed other legends, such as those of Merlin and Tristan, and spawned its own sprawling cast of characters. The places on this page are associated not with Arthur himself but with other characters connected to him.</p>

          <p>Although Merlin has been inextricably associated with Arthur for nearly a millennium, the two characters have distinct origins. In the oldest stories, Myrddin was a 6th-century bard who went mad from witnessing the battle of Arfderydd, after which he took up residence among the animals in the Caledonian Forest and gained prophetic powers. It was the 12th-century Welsh writer Geoffrey of Monmouth who rebranded Myrddin as Merlin (Merlinus in Latin) and linked him with Arthur in his seminal <cite>History of the Kings of Britain</cite>. In Geoffrey’s tale, the British tyrant Vortigern is baffled at his bad luck trying to build a fort on a hill until a young Merlin explains that two dragons, locked in battle in a pool under the hill, keep causing the fort to collapse. It is widely believed that Dinas Emrys is the hill where this story takes place. In Geoffrey’s source, Nennius’ <cite>History of the Britons</cite>, the young prophet was not Merlin but the war leader and probable historical figure Ambrosius Aurelianus. Dinas Emrys means “Emrys’ City”, and Emrys is the Welsh form of Ambrosius.</p>

          <p>Circles of standing stones abound in Great Britain and Ireland, but none is so famous nor so impressive as Stonehenge. Originally constructed around 2500 BC and modified throughout the following centuries, Stonehenge once consisted of an outer circle of thirty tall sandstone blocks called sarsens topped with horizontal stones called lintels, encircling a smaller arrangement of both sarsen and bluestone megaliths. This stunning feat of Neolithic engineering captured the imagination of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who called it <i lang="la">Chorea Gigantum</i>: the Giants’ Ring, or Giants’ Dance. According to Geoffrey’s <cite>History of the Kings of Britain</cite>, ancient giants had transported the stones from their original home in Africa to Ireland. They arrived in Britain through the cunning of Merlin, who transported them at the request of the ruler and military leader Aurelius Ambrosius (elsewhere known as Ambrosius Aurelianus) as a memorial to the British casualties in the war against the Saxons.</p>

          <p>While the part about the giants is (presumably) pure imagination, the part about the stones having come from far away may preserve a grain of truth. Recent geological analysis indicates that the bluestones were quarried about 180 kilometers to the west, in what is now Wales. Thus, when Geoffrey tells of Merlin transporting the building blocks of Stonehenge across the water from Ireland, he comes surprisingly close to the truth, whether through a millennia-long game of telephone or through pure coincidence.</p>

        <h3>The Tristan Stone (Cornwall, England)</h3>
        <div class="vertical unit">
          <div class="border"></div>
          <img src="images/places/tristanstone1.jpg" alt="the Tristan Stone up close">
          <p>Like Merlin, Tristan (or Tristram), the Cornish knight with a gift for music and an inconvenient infatuation with his uncle’s wife Iseult (or Isolde), is nowadays known as a member of Arthur’s circle, but like that of Merlin, Tristan’s legend seems to have begun as its own self-contained story, rather than an outgrowth of Arthur’s. What sets Tristan apart from both Merlin and Arthur is a single piece of physical evidence for his historical existence, albeit a very dubious one. Research on the seven-foot-tall monolith known as the Tristan Stone is scant, but the consensus is that its Latin inscription, now nearly illegible, once commemorated one Drustanus, son of Cunomorus. Drustanus is the Latin form of Tristan, while "Cunomorus" is probably the Latin form of the Welsh name Cynvawr. Cynvawr was a 6th-century ruler, who, in a few early British texts, is said also to have been known as Mark—the name of Tristan’s uncle and Iseult’s husband. The 16th-century antiquarian John Leland claims, tantalizingly, that a third line, now completely eroded, read <i lang="la">CUM DOMINA OUSILLA</i>, or “with the lady Ousilla”—possibly a Latinization of Iseult?</p>

          <p>In the 1980s, the Tristan Stone was moved to its present location just outside the town of Fowey, but up to that point—possibly, as far as anyone knows, ever since it was erected—it stood much closer to another site associated with the legend of Tristan and Iseult: the Iron Age hillfort known as Castle Dore.</p>

          <p>Like Badbury Rings and Cadbury Castle (both detailed on the <a href="ascentandlife.html">Ascent and Life</a> page), Castle Dore does not, at first glance, live up to its name. It is a pretty hill, occupied by cows, unremarkable except for the ditches and banks encircling its sides and marking it as a hillfort. The first archaeologist to excavate at Castle Dore was Ralegh Radford in the 1930s, who concluded that the hill had first been fortified in the Iron Age but reoccupied in the 5th or 6th century AD. Later archaeologists, however, have contested Radford’s interpretation, arguing instead that Castle Dore was exclusively occupied from around the 5th to the 1st century BC.</p>

          <p>Castle Dore is traditionally depicted as the home of Tristan’s uncle, King Mark of Cornwall. This tradition may stem simply from the proximity of the Tristan Stone. <cite>Castle Dor</cite>, a 1942 novel by Daphne du Maurier, is an adaptation of the story of Tristan and Iseult set in the 19th century in the vicinity of the hillfort.</p>

        <h3>Lud’s Church (Staffordshire, England)</h3>

          <img src="images/places/ludschurch2.jpg" alt="smoother walls of Lud’s Church">
          <p>A hike through the woods of northern Staffordshire leads to a chasm in the earth whose mossy sandstone walls reach up to eighteen meters in height. Lud’s Church is such an unusual natural geological formation, it’s hard to believe it wasn’t formed by human hands. It’s fitting, then, that it has been suggested as an inspiration for one of the most unusual and memorable works of medieval Arthurian literature: <cite>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</cite>. This bizarre poem, written in alliterative verse in a dialect of Middle English local to the North West Midlands, focuses on Arthur’s nephew Gawain as he navigates the perils of both otherworldly magic and the chivalric code. A giant green stranger arrives at Arthur’s court on Christmas day and proposes a “game”: one of the knights will behead him, and next Christmas, the green man will return the blow. Gawain bravely volunteers and beheads the Green Knight, who lifts his own severed head, reminds Gawain of the deal, and rides away. After many adventures and tests, Gawain faces the Green Knight at a place called the Green Chapel, for which Lud’s Church might have served as inspiration. In the 15th century, the Lollards, whose heretical Christian views provoked the enmity of the Catholic Church, are believed to have used Lud’s Church as a hiding place.</p>
