      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>On this website, you will find photographs of thirteen places throughout Wales and England associated with the legend of King Arthur, along with descriptions of both the folklore and the real history attached to these places. They are divided into three categories:</p>
        <div class="parallax">
          <ul>
            <li>The <a href="ascentandlife.html">Ascent and Life</a> page explores locations associated with Arthur’s early life, his rise to power, and his military and political career: Tintagel, Dozmary Pool, Badbury Rings, Cadbury, and Caerleon.</li>
            <li>The <a href="downfallanddeath.html">Downfall and Death</a> page explores locations associated with Arthur’s final battle and its aftermath: Slaughterbridge, Glastonbury Abbey, and Glastonbury Tor.</li>
            <li>The <a href="secondarycharacters.html">Secondary Characters</a> page explores locations associated with characters who play a supporting role in Arthur’s legend: Dinas Emrys, Stonehenge, the Tristan Stone, Castle Dore, and Lud’s Church.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, on the <a href="earlysources.html">Early Sources</a> page, you will find an approximate timeline of the earliest literary sources for Arthurian legend, starting with Gildas’ <i>On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain</i> and ending with Gerald of Wales’s <i>The Instruction of a Ruler</i>.</p>
        <p>What does it mean for a site to have Arthurian associations? None of these sites can be confidently linked to a historical Arthur; indeed, there is no consensus as to whether the legend has any basis in history, nor is there ever likely to be one. Arthur’s story takes place in the poorly documented era of British history between the withdrawal of the Roman Empire and the dominion of the Saxon kingdoms. We can say a few things about who he would have been if he was indeed real—for starters, he would almost certainly have been a military leader rather than a king—but beyond that, we are limited to speculation. These places’ associations with the legend have been shaped by a combination of forces:</p>
        <div class="parallax">
          <ul>
            <li>Folklore about local landmarks</li>
            <li>Literature of a clearly imaginative nature</li>
            <li>“Historical” writings, the accuracy of which tends not to hold up to scrutiny</li>
            <li>Archaeology shedding light on Arthur’s time period, but not on Arthur himself</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Whether there is any real history in the mix is anyone’s guess, but what’s for certain is that these sites testify to the cultural significance and staying power of the story of Arthur.</p>
