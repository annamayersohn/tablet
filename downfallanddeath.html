        <p>The Arthurian legend is well known as a tragic story. It ends with the epic battle of Camlann, at which Arthur died...or did he? The places on this page are associated with Arthur’s final battle and the ultimate fate of the once and future king.</p>

        <h3>Slaughterbridge (Cornwall, England)</h3>

          <p>The town of Slaughterbridge sits along the River Camel, which flows from Bodmin Moor through Cornwall to the Celtic Sea. The name of this river, which means “crooked,” may have contributed to Slaughterbridge’s association with the legendary battle of Camlann. The first known written source to mention this battle is the 10th-century <cite>Annals of Wales</cite>, which states that it occurred around the year 537 and that Arthur and Medraut were slain. The chronicle does not specify the relationship between these two individuals, nor whether they fought on the same or opposing sides, but by the time Geoffrey of Monmouth published his <cite>History of the Kings of Britain</cite>, the mysterious Medraut had become Arthur’s treacherous nephew Mordred, whose usurpation of Arthur’s throne led to the battle that cost both uncle and nephew their lives. Later writers added even more drama to the story: Mordred became Arthur’s incestuously conceived son, and he and Arthur were said to have personally delivered each other’s mortal wounds.</p>

          <p>One interesting artifact found at Slaughterbridge is a stone inscribed with Latin and ogham script, dating probably from the mid-first millennium A.D. The inscriptions are very faded and thus hard to interpret, but the presence of the Latin word <i lang="la">iacit</i> (“he lies”) indicates that it once marked a grave. A very imaginative reconstruction of the inscription dating back at least to 1632, when Cornish antiquarian Richard Carew described the stone in his <cite>Survey of Cornwall</cite>, claims that it contains a reference to Arthur. In reality, neither “Arthur” nor even a related name appears on the stone, but it has acquired the moniker “King Arthur’s Stone” nonetheless.</p>

          <p>Today, Slaughterbridge is home to a small museum called the Arthurian Centre. The museum explores both the history of Slaughterbridge and the history of the Arthurian legend, as well as the intersection between the two.</p>

        <h3>Glastonbury Abbey (Somerset, England)</h3>

          <p>In 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey allegedly made a momentous discovery. They unearthed a coffin, containing the bones of a man and a woman, and a lead cross with an inscription declaring (in Latin), “Here lies buried the renowned King Arthur in the Isle of Avalon.” This “discovery” has usually been written off as a scam to raise money after a fire devastated the Abbey in the 1180s, but archaeological work has shown, for what it’s worth, that the excavation really took place. Unfortunately, the bones were lost after Henry VIII dissolved England’s monasteries as part of his break with the Catholic Church. The cross is now lost as well, but it survived long enough for the antiquarian William Camden to produce a careful drawing of it in 1607. Perhaps it will turn up one day.</p>

This tomb survived until the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539.</p></i></div>

        <h3>Glastonbury Tor (Somerset, England)</h3>

          <p>About a mile from the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey as the crow flies, a steep hill rises dramatically from the surrounding lowlands. By time the lead cross (allegedly) marking Arthur’s grave “in the Isle of Avalon" was (allegedly) discovered at the Abbey in the 12th century, these lowlands had been drained, but in the 6th century, they would have been a swamp, and the hill called Glastonbury Tor would have looked rather like an island. As a result, the cross’s reference to an “Isle” at Glastonbury has rendered some Arthurian scholars hesitant to dismiss the artifact out of hand as a 12th-century hoax.</p>

          <p>The tower atop the Tor is all that remains of St. Michael’s church, which was constructed in the 14th century and demolished when Henry VIII put an end to Glastonbury Abbey in 1539. In addition to the Arthurian association, Gwyn ap Nudd, the king of the Otherworld in Welsh mythology, was said to dwell underneath the hill.</p>
